Problem :: 3152. Special Array II
An array is considered special if every pair of its adjacent elements contains two numbers with different parity.
You are given an array of integer nums and a 2D integer matrix queries, where for queries[i] = [fromi, toi] your task is to check that 
subarray
 nums[fromi..toi] is special or not.
Return an array of booleans answer such that answer[i] is true if nums[fromi..toi] is special.

Time complexity :: O(N)
Space Complexity :: O(N)
 
Code ::
class Solution {
public:
  vector<bool> isArraySpecial(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    vector<bool> ans;
    vector<int> converted(1, 0);
    for(int i = 1, j = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i){
        if( (nums[i]%2) == (nums[i-1]%2) ) j++;
        converted.push_back(j);
    }
    for(auto i:converted)cout<<i<<" ";
    for(auto q: queries) ans.push_back( converted[q[0]] == converted[q[1]] );
    return ans;
}
};
